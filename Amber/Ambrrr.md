Amber is being deployed for blockchain organizations, where each brand/org already has an existing community on **Discord**. Ambassadors are members of these communities, and they authenticate using Discord to access the Amber platform.

When an ambassador logs in:

* They authenticate with Discord.  
* Amber fetches their Discord profile (username, server memberships, role, etc.).  
* Ambassador selects which organization/community they are working for (if in multiple Discords).  
* They are redirected to that org's custom workspace within Amber.

Rewards, gamification, and leaderboards are critical for ambassador motivation.
