### **Current Stellar Ambassador Program (from your description)**

* Ambassadors join through **chapters** (per country/region). This means when you join amber as an ambassador, you have to be assigned to a region/country within a chapter  
* Duties/tasks: create content (YouTube, social), attend meetings, host events, spread awareness. We know this already  
* **Funding flow**:  
  1. Chapters get up to **$10k monthly** from parent organization. Chapter heads/leads are called presidents  
  2. They distribute to ambassadors for events & activities.

###  **How Amber Tackles This**

1. **Structured Roles & Chapters**  
   * Amber allows ecosystems like Stellar to **set up chapters. Chapters is per country/region**  
   * Each chapter lead can onboard ambassadors, assign roles, and track contributions.  
2. **Task & Contribution Tracking**  
   * Ambassadors log tasks: YouTube videos, Twitter posts, event hosting.  
   * Proof-of-work (links, screenshots, metrics) submitted directly in Amber.  
   * Ecosystem managers see **who is active, consistent, and impactful** at a glance.  
3. **Funding Transparency**  
   * Monthly chapter funds (e.g., $10k) are deposited in **chapter wallet** by the parent org. Parent orgs are able to fund their own org wallet and from that wallet, send out chapter funds to chapter heads. Chapter heads are called presidents  
   * Chapter leads(presidents) distribute micro-grants or rewards to ambassadors.  
   * Every distribution is **auditable, and visible** to the ecosystem.  
4. **Community Collaboration Layer**  
   * Amber gives chapters a **shared workspace** (like a mini Discord \+ task board).  
   * Ambassadors can request funds.  
   * No single person “gatekeeping.” It feels like teamwork. This is like a community thing where the president can ask suggest tasks or campaigns and ambassadors can vote on them. So there will be a side menu called communities. It will contain ambassador lists, suggested campaigns, polls etc  
5. **Recognition & Growth**  
   * Leaderboards and badges highlight top contributors.

\- In auth, there is orgs, presidents, and ambassadors.

\- ⁠Presidents are responsible for chapters; chapters can be countries or regions

\- ⁠If logged in/sign up as a president you have to be added to an organisation. 

\- ⁠Presidents receive $10k monthly to distribute to ambassadors as rewards. There are some tasks that ambassadors would need to receive money from presidents to carry out.
